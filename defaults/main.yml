# * Optional Variables *
# ----------------------


# * BigBlueButton Configuration *

# Here you can disable the process and publish
# steps of the recording workflow.
# You _usually_ want to do this, if you use

# you use the post-publish workflow
bbb_oc_disable_bbb_presentation: true

# Control if users have the ability to start
# and stop recording during the meeting.

# Automatically start recording at the beginning
# of the meeting.
# This can be helpful in automated settings,
# but be aware of possible privacy issues.
bbb_oc_auto_start_recording: false

# This flag allows to switch on recordings
# if by some other way they have been deactivated
# in the past. You usually likely do not want this
# variable to be set to 'true' if you use this integration.
bbb_oc_disable_recording: false


# * Opencast Configuration *

# Workflow to use for ingest
# try 'bbb-upload' for post_archive
# and 'schedule-and-upload' for post_publish
bbb_oc_opencast_workflow: 'bbb-upload'

# Specify which additional files you want to send to Opencast

# Send the webcam recordings to Opencast.
# If your Opencast is any version earlier than 9.1, you MUST set this to false.
# Default: true
bbb_oc_webcam_tracks: true

# Adds the shared notes etherpad from a meeting to the attachments in Opencast

# Please make sure to use this feature respectfully.
# Default: false
bbb_oc_presentations_as_pdf: false


# * Cleanup *

# If and how the script should delete raw recording files from BBB

# Removes the raw recording data from BBB if the script sent all the data to Opencast successfully.
# Set to false if there are other post_archive scripts after this one, or else they will
# likely fail due to the missing data.
# Although data will only ever be deleted after the script was successful and the first thing
# Opencast does (in the bbb-upload Workflow) is to make a snapshot of all the data it got,
# there may still be edge cases where data loss can occur. If you absolutely cannot accept
# any data loss, set this option to false.
# Default: true
bbb_oc_delete_if_successful: true

# Marks the raw recording data for deletion by the BBB clean-up cron job.
# This will have no effect if the cron job is disabled.
# This will have no effect if "deleteIfSuccessful" is set to true.
# Default: false
bbb_oc_delete_by_bbbcron: false


# * Default Roles *

# Allows you to add default Opencast roles to every recording

# Default roles for the event, e.g. "ROLE_OAUTH_USER, ROLE_USER_BOB"
# Default: ""
bbb_oc_read_perm: ""
bbb_oc_write_perm: ""

# Default roles for the series, e.g. "ROLE_OAUTH_USER, ROLE_USER_BOB"

bbb_oc_series_write_perm: ""


# * Various other options *

# Whether to skip processing if no series ID was submitted as meeting metadata
# Default: true
bbb_oc_skip_processing_if_no_series_id_set: false

# The given dublincore identifier will also passed to the dublincore source tag,
# even if the given identifier cannot be used as the actual identifier for the vent
# Default: false
bbb_oc_pass_identifier_as_dc_source: false

# Default: false
bbb_oc_only_ingest_if_record_button_was_pressed: false

# If a converted video already exists, don't overwrite it
# This can save time when having to run this script on the same input multiple times
# Default: false
bbb_oc_do_not_convert_videos_again: false

# Minimal accepted duration of recordings in seconds
# This value can be used to discard recordings that are shorter than this value.
# This can be helpful when dealing with a lot of short videos due to people peeking into
# conferences before they start and that have set 'autoStartRecording' to 'true'.
bbb_oc_minimal_duration: 0


# * Monitoring *

# Monitor Opencast workflow state after ingest to determine whether the workflow was successful.
# EXPERIMENTIAL! This may cause the process spawned from this script to run a lot longer than anticipated.

# Default: false
bbb_oc_monitor_opencast_after_ingest: false
# Time between each state check in seconds
bbb_oc_seconds_between_checks: 300
